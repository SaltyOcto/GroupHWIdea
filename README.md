Group homework to understand CRM

Project done in Android Studio. It is a basic contact manager application where you can
add contacts that are placed in a ListView. There are comments for every line if you want to 
know the logic behind it. 

.java files are stored in app/src/main/java/com/example/test
(yeah it's kinda far into the folders)

clone and try for yourself if you want to. need an android device or install a emulator through android studio
